Kapor Center Project
Jarred Aultman

This project is an implementation of of a virtual pet called PetPal.

PetPal contains the following features that affect the Pet:
  - Feed
  - Poke
  - Watch	
  	- Sleeping
    - Laughing
  - Kill

  
When the Pet owner (user) clicks any of those buttons, the Pet will respond accordingly. If by any chance the user neglects the Pet and forgets to feed it, it will die and a dialog box will pop up and give an option to start over or quit.

Images will change in response to the button clicked. These images are contained in the Images folder within this project and can be accessed from there. Images must be contained within that folder as the path within the classes are set to look within an Images folder.

Here is a screencast video of the PetPal application via YouTUbe.
